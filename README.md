# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cricket Matches

## Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on cricket match data to derive meaningful insights and answer analytical questions. The analysis leverages two datasets:

1. **Matches Dataset**: Provides information about matches, teams, outcomes, venues, and more.
2. **Deliveries Dataset**: Contains ball-by-ball details for each match, covering batting, bowling, and extras information.

The goal is to explore the data thoroughly and address various queries, including team performance, player statistics, venue trends, and more.
